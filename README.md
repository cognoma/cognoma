# Project Cognoma

_Putting machine learning in the hands of cancer biologists._

Project Cognoma is an open source project to create a webapp for analyzing cancer data.
We're a community-driven philanthropic project that began as a collaboration between the [Greene Lab](http://www.greenelab.com/ "Greene Lab at Penn"), [DataPhilly](https://www.meetup.com/DataPhilly/ "DataPhilly Meetup"), and [Code for Philly](https://codeforphilly.org/ "Code for Philly").
Our contributors are primarily based in the Philadelphia area, but anyone anywhere is welcome.
This GitHub repository is the administrative and informational home of Cognoma.

The Meetup phase of Cognoma is now complete!
The [Childhood Cancer Data Lab](https://www.ccdatalab.org/) of [Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation](https://www.alexslemonade.org/) will be providing longterm maintenance.
Public **contributions are still welcome** through GitHub.
The main priority is enhancements and bug fixes to improve http://cognoma.org.
For a nice overview of the project, see its [coverage by The Philadelphia Citizen](http://thephiladelphiacitizen.org/code-for-cancer/ "Code for Cancer by Roxanne Shepelavy. Philadelphia Citizen. 2017-10-25").

## Teams and Repositories

The project is composed of four teams with their own corresponding repositories:

| Team Name | Repositories | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Cancer Data | [`cancer-data`](https://github.com/cognoma/cancer-data), [`genes`](https://github.com/cognoma/genes), [`figshare`](https://github.com/cognoma/figshare) | processing the underlying cancer data to the formats required for this project. |
| Machine Learning | [`machine-learning`](https://github.com/cognoma/machine-learning), [`cognoml`](https://github.com/cognoma/cognoml) | building classifiers to predict mutation status from gene expression data. |
| Backend | [`core-service`](https://github.com/cognoma/core-service), [`task-service`](https://github.com/cognoma/task-service), [`ml-workers`](https://github.com/cognoma/ml-workers), [`infrastructure`](https://github.com/cognoma/infrastructure) | creating the infrastructure to power the webapp and glue the components together. |
| Frontend | [`frontend`](https://github.com/cognoma/frontend), [`uiux`](https://github.com/cognoma/uiux) | building the webapp that users interact with. |

## New Here?

If you are a new user and would like to get involved, please [introduce yourself](https://github.com/cognoma/cognoma/issues/2 "Issue #2: Introduce yourself here to get involved").
Contributions are made through GitHub, so if you are unfamiliar with git or GitHub, check out the [`sandbox`](https://github.com/cognoma/sandbox) for a place to learn by doing.

## Meetup Schedule

We hold project meetups.
Our usual meeting spot is at Industrious (where CandiDate is located).
The address is [230 S Broad St, Floor 17, Philadelphia](https://goo.gl/maps/Anoo4SUE9At "Google Maps").
