# Project Cognoma

_Putting machine learning in the hands of cancer biologists._

Project Cognoma is collaborative project between the [Greene Lab](http://www.greenelab.com/), the [DataPhilly](http://www.meetup.com/DataPhilly/) & the [Code for Philly](https://codeforphilly.org/) meetups, and anyone else who would like to participate. We're building a web application that will give cancer biologists an easy way to build and apply machine learning models.

Stay tuned for details and information on how to contribute.
