# Project Cognoma

_Putting machine learning in the hands of cancer biologists._

Project Cognoma is an open source project to create a webapp for analyzing cancer data. We're a community-driven philanthropic project that began as a collaboration between the [Greene Lab](http://www.greenelab.com/ "Greene Lab at Penn"), [DataPhilly](https://www.meetup.com/DataPhilly/ "DataPhilly Meetup"), and [Code for Philly](https://codeforphilly.org/ "Code for Philly"). Our contributors are primarily based in the Philadelphia area, but anyone anywhere is welcome. This GitHub repository is the administrative and informational home of Cognoma.

## Teams and Repositories

The project is composed of four teams with their own corresponding repositories:

| Team Name | Repositories | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Cancer Data | [`cancer-data`](https://github.com/cognoma/cancer-data) | processing the underlying cancer data to the formats required for this project. See . |
| Machine Learning | [`machine-learning`](https://github.com/cognoma/machine-learning) | building classifiers to predict mutation status from gene expression data. |
| Backend | [`django-cognoma`](https://github.com/cognoma/django-cognoma), [`task-service`](https://github.com/cognoma/task-service) | creating the infrastructure to power the webapp and glue the components together. |
| Frontend | [`frontend`](https://github.com/cognoma/frontend), [`cognoma.github.io`](https://github.com/cognoma/cognoma.github.io) | building the webapp that users interact with. |

## New Here?

If you are a new user and would like to get involved, please [introduce yourself](https://github.com/cognoma/cognoma/issues/2 "Issue #2: Introduce yourself here to get involved"). Contributions are made through GitHub, so if you are unfamiliar with git or GitHub, check out the [`sandbox`](https://github.com/cognoma/sandbox) for a place to learn by doing.

## Meetup Schedule

We hold project meetups. Our usual meeting spot is at Industrious (where CandiDate is located). The address is [230 S Broad St, Floor 17, Philadelphia](https://goo.gl/maps/Anoo4SUE9At "Google Maps").
